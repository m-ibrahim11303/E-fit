Explanation of the code:

The code is divided in a tree like structure.

The parent node is: main.dart

The children of the parent are all of the buttons present on the home screen of the app:
1. exercise_screen
2. diet_screen
3. analytics_screen
4. forum_screen
5. settings_screen
Some of these screens are present inside of directories with the same name but in plural, e.g: diet_screens.
This is to promote readability of the code.

All of the things remaining to implement are mentioned below. The paths are relative to main.dart.

Backend integration (PRIORITY):

/main.dart : add a GET to the backend for the user history graphs. A placeholder url is already being used,
    just replace it.
/diet_screens/water_screen.dart : Add a POST to the backend whenvever save is clicked. Just add an async
    function at the 'onPressed' section where I'm updated the context.
/diet_screens/diet_screens.dart : Add a POST to the backend whenver save is clicked after selecting food items.
    Just add an async function at the 'onPressed' section where I'm updated the context.
/diet_screens/diet_screens.dart : Add a GET to the backend to update the json variable that is being used to 
    display eatery information. Update the big json file to instead call an async function returning a json 
    file with the same format which can be used to display all these eateries

Miscallenous:
/diet_screens/diet_screens.dart : Input validation for custom meals

Important features:
/forum_screen.dart : Not implemented - 
    Need to connect backend to current overlay, add commenting and voting functionality alongside connecting that to the backend
